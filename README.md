# The Bruh Application
This application listens for the keywords "Bruh" or "Bro" and plays the Bruh sound effect.

This application makes use of [DroidSpeech2.0](https://github.com/vikramezhil/DroidSpeech2.0/) to dictate the input from the user.

## Why?

I conducted a poll on my Instagram asking followers to give me ideas for apps they would like to see, this particular application was just so ridiculous I thought, why not?
